[Andrew Hoell, Chris Funk, Jens Zinke, Laura Harrison: Modulation of the Southern Africa precipitation response to the El Niño Southern Oscillation by the subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-016-3220-6)


**What scientific questions are the authors addressing?**  
How the phase of the SIOD and therefore the SST anomaly expression of the Indian Ocean, modulates the Southern Africa precipitation response to ENSO?

**What methods do the authors use to address the questions?**  

* SA Land area bound by the region 15S-35S; 12.5E-42.5E
* Observation: Global Precipitation Climatology Project version 2.2 (GPCP) 1979 to 2014, 2.5 x 2.5 deg resolution. Hadley-NOAA Optimum Interpolation dataset (OISST) 1.0x1.0 deg
* Three SST modes and their indices: ENSO (Nino3.4 >0.5K, table 2), IOD, Subtropical-IOD (Fig. 1)
* Two experiments: (1) Forced by observed global SST (2) Forced by the leading pattern of glabal time-varying monthly SST anomaly added to the monthly climatology, to isolate the atmospheric response to ENSO. (EOF1, Fig. 4) 
* Each experiment has two sets of ensembles from two different models:(1) 30 members of ECHAM5.4, 50 members of GFS2, on 1x1 deg horizonal grid.
* Test whether the SIOD modifies the relationship between SA precipitation and ENSO through an examination of SA precipitation as a function of SIOD phase in two forced simulations.

**What are the authors' main conclusions?**

* El Niño is associated with reduced precipitation in the Southern Africa, and La Niña tends to occur with abundant precipitation in the area. Both are further enhanced by out-of-phase SIOD, and disrupted by in-phase SIOD. 
* For the in-phase SIOD and ENSO during December-March, SA precipitation is associated with an SST anomaly over the *Agulhas Current region.*
* ENSO is related to an equivalent barotropic Rossby wave over Southern Africa, that modifies the regional mid-tropospheric vertical motions and precipitation. 
* The EOF1 forced case, either phase of SIOD does not modulate the SA precipitation response to ENSO (indistinguishable Fig. 10 and 11)

**What are the implications of the results?**

ENSO has been an important parameter for rainy season SA precipitation prediction, as SST playing a critical role in the regional climate. The modulation relationship between SIOD and ENSO presented here can help to make more informed forecasts.
