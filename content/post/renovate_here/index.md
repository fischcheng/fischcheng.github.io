I've just spent the long weekend updating my nearly-abandoned website. This year, I have passed my qualifying exam (February), and the paper I've been working on for almost an year is now finally accepted.

The website has been changed to a GitHub user-page, instead of a project-page. Also, now the website is automatically generated by Travis-CI, a very popular service recently, testing and deploying the codes to ensure portability. All the changes and new posts are made on my laptop. Html pages are built by Pelican/Python3, on the /source branch. A push to the remote host will trigger Travis-CI. With a little help from ghp-import, the Travis-CI-generated pages will be force-pushed to the /master branch. Voila, that is the website now you are looking at.

Through this little-over-two-days endeavor, I now had more knowledge on Github, Travis-CI, and more control on my own website templates. Now it's just the matter of keeping things rolling -- I made the resolution to post more frequently. In fact, I have just updated the Work page to include some of my recent presentations and abstracts. I will also post some of the notes from our group meeting.
