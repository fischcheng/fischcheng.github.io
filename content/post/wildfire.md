Last week was tough for everyone in Seattle due to the bad air quality. Sadly, it was nothing compared to what we have this week. The Air Quality Index (AQI) reached well above 150 since Monday, which is roughly equal to "[smoking seven cigarettes in a day](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/8/21/17761908/seattle-air-quality-haze-smoke-wildfire-health)." The hazardous smoke is attributed to the surrounding massive wildfires, and the onshore winds are expected to arrive first in the Wednesday evening.
