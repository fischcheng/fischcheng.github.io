title: "Quantifying Agulhas leakage in a coupled climate model"
event: "PuPPy Scientific Computing meetup"
event_url: "https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython/events/254694325/"

location: "Seattle, Washington"

summary: ""
abstract: "Agulhas leakage carries the warm and salty water from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean, potentially modulating the thermohaline circulation and thus the climate. We use a high-resolution coupled climate model to study leakage, its variability and climate impact. The first challenge we face: how to quantify leakage while no direct observations are available?"
