I am a teaching assistant for the following courses at University of Miami:

* ATM/MSC 118 *Current topics of Weather and Climate*: gave a 50 min lecture about [*"Ocean & Climate change"*](http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/ycheng/pdfs/Mar_19_Oceans_and_Climate_Change).

* MSC 220 [*Climate & Global Change*](http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/pzuidema/Flyer_220.pdf): two talks were given: the first one covered *"Water, aerosols and ozone"* and the second talk was titled [*"climate change mitigation."*](http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/ycheng/pdfs/20141204_MSC220_Mitigation)
