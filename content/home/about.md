# About

I'm a PhD student/Research assistant in the department of physical oceanography, Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science, University of Miami, working under the supervision of Dr. Lisa Beal and Dr. Ben Kirtman. My work is trying to identify the missing links between Agulhas leakage and the Atlantic Meridional Oerturning circulation in a High-Resolution coupled climate model.  

Beside research, I am a big enthusiast of every sports with racquets. I play in local tennis league, school badminton club and restringing racquets is one of my greatest passions. In fact, the Miami OPEN every March is one of the reasons that urged me to make the decision to come here. I've volunteered for the tournament for since I came to Miami four years ago. If you happen to be in the region and want to hit fuzzy green balls around, but lacking partners, please contact me!
