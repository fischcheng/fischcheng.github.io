# Biography

I'm a PhD student/Research assistant in the department of physical oceanography, Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science, University of Miami, working under the supervision of Dr. Lisa Beal and Dr. Ben Kirtman. My work focuses on identifying the missing links between Agulhas leakage and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning circulation using a High-Resolution coupled climate model.  

Beside research, I am a big fan of every sports with racquets. I play in local tennis league, school badminton club and restringing racquets is one of my greatest passions. In fact, the Miami Open every March is one of the reasons that urged me to decide to come here. I've volunteered for the tournament multiple times as ballperson. If you happen to be in the region and want to hit the fuzzy yellow ball around, please contact me!
