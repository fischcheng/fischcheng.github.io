# Hi there,

I'm a physical oceanographer/climate modeler in the department of ocean sciences at the Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science of University of Miami. My research focuses on identifying the missing links between Agulhas leakage and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning circulation using a High-Resolution coupled climate model. Specifically, I track millions of virtual particles to quantify Agulhas leakage. Coming from a atmospheric science background, I want to combine my experiences in climate modeling, scientific programming and physical oceanography to ask more challenging questions.

Beside research, I am a big fan of any sports with racquets. I play in local tennis leagues, school badminton club and restringing racquets is one of my passions. I relocated to Seattle last summer due to family concern, and am now actively seeking for job positions.
